Analysis code for studies on Hbb vs gluon bb studies.

# Environment Setup
The following instructions assume running inside VSCode.
 
```
module load python/3.8-anaconda-2020.11
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The code itself does not depend on VSCode and can be run as standalone Python.
However the environment setup in that case is left as an exercise to the user.

# Generating Graphs
Graphs are generated by the `hbbgbb/generate.py`, whose files are saved in the specified `DIRECTORY` folder on line 32, within hbbgbb folder.
Run `make all` in VSCode to generate the standard set of files used for the graph models.
Current standard (r10201 and r9364 tags)- 
    hh_bbbb mass: 1100, 1200, 1400
    jetjet JZ slice: 5

Line 79 generates a single graph given a single jet. It is a call to `data.LoadGraph.create_single_graph`

# Training Model
In the graph dataset loading stage, lines 56-62 in `model_graph` must be altered 
```
data.Graph_loader(..... graph_dir= <path to graphs>)
data.load_all(.... num_batches = <upper bound on number of batches>)
```

For each epoch: 
    - score distribution of the last batch is saved to `scores/`
    - ROC curve from the last batch is saved in `epochs/`
